        <li>They only contain **letters from A to Z** (no umlauts or special characters).</li>
        <li>They **do not contain any duplicate letters**.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, please be aware that despite these guidelines, **some words encountered during gameplay or within the game's features may be ambiguous or more appropriate for adult players.**</p>
    <p>Players may encounter such words in various scenarios, for instance:</p>

        <li>An opponent player may choose such a word as their secret word.</li>

        <li>In the **"dictionary" section**, such words may appear as "proposals" where manually curated words are suggested and made available for voting.</li>
    </ul>
