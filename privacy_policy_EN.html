    <h2>What data is transmitted?</h2>
    <p>The game does not store user data, but it uses an installation UUID to enable the expandability of the dictionary. Further usage data includes IP address, timestamp, language setting, and other game-relevant data.</p>

    <h2>Expandable Dictionary</h2>
    <p>To expand the dictionary used in the game, players can submit new word suggestions and, if applicable, vote on suggestions from other players.</p>
    <p>Both suggestions and votes are transmitted anonymously. For this purpose, a random UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is generated upon the first use of the game, which is stored on the device and used for future sessions. This UUID is stored on the device and linked to the game installation.</p>
    <p>The following list enumerates already included and planned functions that, when used, lead to data (such as UUID, IP address, timestamp) being exchanged with a server, stored in server log files, and being saved and processed for the proper functioning of the game.</p>

    <h3>Submitting Word Suggestions</h3>
    <p>To expand the list of words allowed in the game, a player can submit word suggestions, which may be included in future product versions.<br>Data (UUID, language, word suggestion, IP address, timestamp)</p>

    <h3>Retrieving Word Suggestions</h3>
    <p>The game can retrieve a list of word suggestions that may be offered to the user for voting.<br>Data (language, word suggestion, IP address, timestamp)</p>

    <h3>Voting on Word Suggestions</h3>
    <p>To have word suggestions reviewed by a wider audience, players may view and vote on word suggestions submitted by other players.<br>Data (UUID, word suggestion, vote +/-, (opt.) reasons for rejection, IP address, timestamp)</p>

    <h2>Inquiries</h2>
    <p>To process any inquiries, for example, in the context of your rights under GDPR, providing your UUID is required. You can copy your UUID to the clipboard by long-pressing (long-tap) the game logo. Please include the UUID thus determined in your inquiry.</p>
    <p>Inquiries should be sent via email to the above email address, stating the relevant UUID. Responses will only be provided via email.</p>
